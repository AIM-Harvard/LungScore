<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>The Lung Age repository is structured as follows:</p><br>

<ul>
<li><p>All the source code to run the deep-learning-based fully automatic lung health quantification pipeline is found under the lungage folder.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Four sample subjects' CT data, as well as all the models weights necessary to run the pipeline, are stored under the data folder.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Statistical analysis are located in the stats_analysis folder.</p></li><br>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>For the code to run as intended, all the packages under requirements.txt should be installed. In order not to break previous installations and ensure full compatibility, it's highly recommended to create a     virtual environment to run the DeepCAC pipeline in. Here follows an example of set-up using python virtualenv:</p><br>
