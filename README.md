<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>The Lung Age repository is structured as follows:</p><br>

<ul>
<li><p>All the source code to run the deep-learning-based fully automatic coronary calcium risk assessment pipeline is found under the src folder.</p></li><br>
<li><p>Four sample subjects' CT data and the associated manual segmentation masks (heart + CAC), as well as all the models weights necessary to run the pipeline, are stored under the data folder.</p></li><br>
<li><p>AI and manual results for the NLST cohort in the paper as well as the statistical analysis are located in the stats folder.</p></li><br>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>For the code to run as intended, all the packages under requirements.txt should be installed. In order not to break previous installations and ensure full compatibility, it's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to run the DeepCAC pipeline in. Here follows an example of set-up using python virtualenv:</p><br>
